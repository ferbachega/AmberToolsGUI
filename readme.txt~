To correctly calculate surfaces (using gassian CUBE files):
Please replace the file ... / pDynamo-1.7.2/pBabel-1.7.2/pBabel/GaussianCubeFileWriter.py, 
by the file "GaussianCubeFileWriter.py" which is distributed together with GTKDynamo.	


				---	GTKDynamo Installation	---


	--	Linux	-- 


		External libraries

      GTKDynamo required that some external libraries must be installed earlier. 
The linux repository can download four external libraries, if you are using Ubuntu 
just type:
      
	>	sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib python-numpy python-gtk* pymol

or if you are using OpenSuSe type:

	>	sudo zypper install python-matplotlib python-numpy-devel python-get-devel pymol


      The pDynamo library installation is fully explained at the pDynamo website, 
the ORCA binary files can be downloaded at the website 
(http://www.mpibac.mpg.de/bac/logins/neese/description.php) and these binaries 
must been set in the PATH.


		GTKDynamo
       
      The GTKDynamo does not need to be installed, you just go the GTKDynamo 
folder and type:
      
	>	pymol GTKDynamo.py
	
	
	--	Mac OS X	--


	The interface implementation on Mac OS X is fully accepted, however we just need 
to clarify some tricks about PyMol installation using MacPorts. 
All Mac OS X users can download MacPorts (http://www.macports.org)	to easily install 
programs, but sometimes we need to change some files to getthe right (or the more 
appropriate)	libraries. We recommend using MacPorts to install PyMolp program with 
python 2.7. The default"Portfile" when we are using MacPorts to get PyMol is python 2.6, 
so we need to replace it by python 2.7 library.				
Usually, MacPorts will create a new directory in your computer (/opt/local). All programs 
will be installed using the information provided by the "Portfile", and it's this file thatwe 
have to edit. Do itis simple.Go to the terminal and type:


	$ cd opt/local/var/macports/sources/rsync.macports.org/release/tarballs/ports/science/pymol/
	

      In this folder we have to edit the "Portfile" file:

In this file we have to change the parts highlighted to:

	After, just type:

	$ sudo port install pymol
      
      This command will install PyMol with python 2.7. ?Since GTK_Dynamo requires 
GTK and Matplotlib libraries, type: 
	
	$ sudo port install py27-gtk py27-matplotlib

      After these libraries were installed, your GTK_Dynamo interface should work 
properly. However, we need to perform one more step to setup GTK Dynamo in a 
fashionable way, to type:
	
	$ vi .gtkrc-2.0

      and add this highlighted lines:
 _______________________________________________________________________
|									|
|# -- THEME AUTO-WRITTEN DO NOT EDIT -- #				|
|include "/opt/local/share/themes/MurrinaNGCompact/gtk-2.0/gtkrc"	|
|									|
|include "/Users/luisfernando/.gtkrc-2.0.mine"				|
|									|
|**gtk-toolbar-style   = GTK_TOOLBAR_ICONS	**			|
|**gtk-font-name = "Droid Sans 8"		**			|
|									|
|#	--	THEME AUTO-WRITTEN DO NOT EDIT		--	#	|
|_______________________________________________________________________|


To check if the interface works well, go to GTK_Dynamo folder and type:
      $ pymol GTK_Dynamo.py
